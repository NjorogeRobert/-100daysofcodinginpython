DAY 2
Here I LEARNT DIFFERENT DATA TYPE USED IN PYTHON
This data types are:
1)Integers - Which are whole numbers(either positive or negative)
2) Float - which are numbers with decimal places
3) Strings- a number of characters written inside the "". example "hello"
4) Boolean - There are only two ie True or False.

Learnt on using the type() function to check the type of literal(data type) you are working with:
example
type(123)

Learnt on changing one data type to another
for example changing integer to string

num = 123
str(num)


The following are fucntions used to change one data type to another
change to integer -> int()
change to string -> str()
change to boolean -> bool()
change to float -> float()


Simple arithmetic while changing to a float from a string
print(70 + float("100.5"))
output= 170.5
Manipulation of data using 
+=
-=
*=
/=
signs


Fstrings
learnt on how to manipulate data using fstrings
